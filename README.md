# Ansys-Fluent-TS-Waves-Analysis
Analysis and Observations of Ts waves has been done using ansys fluent 2025 R1 
 
Title              : "Observation of Tollmien-Schliting Waves in simple 2D Flow"
Objective          : "To study formation of T-S Waves under varying inlet velocitites"
Background/Theory  : Analysis of 2D cross-sectional of a Circular pipe flow for the occurences of TS Waves
Tools Used         : ANSYS Fluent, etc.
Methodology        : geometry creation → meshing → solver setup → post-processing
Results            : Insert plots/graphs (e.g., Lift vs AoA graph, stress contour images).
Future Work        : Analysing behaviour under different types of Fluids
How to Reproduce    : Instructions for someone who wants to rerun your simulation/code.
